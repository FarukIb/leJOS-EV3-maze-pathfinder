# leJOS-EV3-maze-pathfinder
Java program to make a Lego EV3 robot learn a maze completely.

The code still has a few bugs which will slightly affect the speed of the robot but it still works.

I took a short break to focus on other things but I will be making changes to this code soon.

For now the robot works on any maze with quadrants, each one a square 30cm long. The code will be optimized to work faster on mazes only when you are put in the lower-left corner of the maze.
I will also make a video essay explaining the movements of the robot soon.
